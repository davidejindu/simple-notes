# simple-notes
Simple Notes is a full-stack AI-enhanced note-taking app built with the MERN stack. It features user authentication using JWT, and integrates Googleâ€™s Gemini API to allow users to create and edit notes using natural language prompts. The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for a responsive, modern UI, while the backend handles secure user sessions and stores notes in MongoDB. This project demonstrates full authentication flow, protected routes, prompt-based content generation, and Markdown rendering.
